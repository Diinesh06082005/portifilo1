Personal Portfolio Website

1. Project Description

This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. The project was built to demonstrate mastery of core web technologies including semantic HTML5, modern CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid), and JavaScript interactivity.

It features a clean, modern interface with a sticky navigation bar, a responsive card-based project gallery, and a functional contact form with validation. The site is optimized for performance and accessibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

2. Tech Stack

HTML5: Used for semantic structure (<header>, <main>, <article>, <footer>) to ensure good SEO and accessibility.

CSS3:

Layout: Utilized Flexbox for the navbar and alignment, and CSS Grid for the responsive project gallery.

Theming: Implemented CSS Variables (:root) for easy color management and a Dark/Light Mode toggle.

Animations: Added keyframe animations for the page loader and hover effects for interactive elements.

Responsive Design: Media queries ensure the layout adapts to screens from mobile (320px) to desktop (1200px+).

JavaScript: Vanilla JS used for the mobile hamburger menu toggle, theme switching logic (persisted via LocalStorage), and form validation.

5. What I Learned

Through building this project, I gained practical experience in:

Advanced CSS Layouts: Mastering the difference between Flexbox (1D layout) and Grid (2D layout) to build complex interfaces without frameworks.

State Management: Using JavaScript and LocalStorage to save user preferences (Dark Mode) so the theme persists across page reloads.

Responsive Design Principles: Adopting a "mobile-first" approach and using relative units (rem, %, vh) instead of fixed pixels.

GitHub Workflow: I learned how to properly simulate a professional workflow by using feature branches (feature/navbar, feature/responsive), creating Pull Requests, and merging code safely instead of pushing directly to the main branch.
